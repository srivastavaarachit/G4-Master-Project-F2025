## About The Project

**PROJECT SPYN** is an autonomous wheelchair-accessible vehicle designed to safely pick up, transport, and drop off wheelchair-bound passengers without external assistance.

### The Problem We're Solving

Traditional transportation options often lack accessibility features or require human assistance, limiting independence for wheelchair users. SPYN provides a fully autonomous solution with:

- Robotic arm mechanism for wheelchair pickup and placement
- Sensor-based safety systems for obstacle detection
- Precise arm control for secure wheelchair handling

### Final User

Elderly and disabled people who require wheelchair-accessible transportation.
