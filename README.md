## About The Project

**PROJECT SPYN** is an autonomous wheelchair-accessible vehicle designed to safely pick up, transport, and drop off wheelchair-bound passengers without external assistance. Built as a 1:8 scale prototype using the LEGO Education MINDSTORMS EV3 kit and programmed in MATLAB, this project addresses critical mobility challenges faced by elderly and disabled individuals.

### The Problem We're Solving

Traditional transportation options often lack accessibility features or require human assistance, limiting independence for wheelchair users. SPYN provides a fully autonomous solution with:

- Dual-side ramp deployment for flexible boarding
- Rotating platform for optimal passenger orientation
- Sensor-based safety systems for obstacle detection
- ADA-compliant ramp slope (1:12 ratio)

### Final User

Elderly and disabled people who require wheelchair-accessible transportation.
